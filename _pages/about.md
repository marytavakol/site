I am an Assistant Professor at the [Uncertainty in AI](https://uai.win.tue.nl/#intro) group of [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [AI](https://www-ai.cs.uni-dortmund.de/allgemein.html) group at [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/). Before that, I was a member of [Machine Learning](http://ml3.leuphana.de/) group at [Leuphana University](https://www.leuphana.de/) of LÃ¼neburg as a Research Assistant, and pursuing my PhD in Machine Learning in the Computer Science department of [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). During my PhD, I spent a six-month internship at the Recommendation team of [Criteo](https://www.criteo.com/) Company in France.

I received both of my B.Sc. and M.Sc degrees in Computer Science from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), Iran.
